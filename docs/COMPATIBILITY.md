# Compatibility

**Verified working on Hyprland and, since the PipeWire capture backend
landed, KDE Plasma.** Everything else below is an assessment of what would be
required, not a claim that it works. labwc has a backend contributed and used
by its author, untested by the maintainer. GNOME and Sway remain untested.

Run [`scripts/moreland-doctor.sh`](../scripts/moreland-doctor.sh) to get this
answer for your own machine: it checks the compositor, the capture protocol,
the VA-API encoder and the ADB link, and names what blocks you.

## Verified

| | |
|---|---|
| Compositor | Hyprland 0.56.2 |
| GPU | AMD Cezanne / Vega (VCN 2.x), VA-API |
| Host OS | Arch / EndeavourOS |
| Android client | Android 14 / API 34 |

## What is actually compositor-specific

Less than you would expect. Three of the four pipeline stages are portable:

| Stage | Portability |
|---|---|
| Capture | `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` — a **standard** staging protocol, not wlroots-specific |
| Encode | VA-API via GStreamer — any GPU with a VA driver; modifiers are probed at runtime |
| Transport | ADB — identical everywhere |
| **Virtual output creation** | **compositor-specific — this is the whole problem** |

The compositor dependency is isolated in `crates/daemon/src/output.rs`, and the
interface is one idea: *create a headless output with this name and mode, and
remove it later*. Adding a compositor means implementing that and nothing else.

## Per-compositor assessment

### Hyprland — works

```bash
hyprctl output create headless moreland
hyprctl keyword monitor "moreland,1920x1200@60,1920x0,1"
hyprctl output remove moreland
```

Hyprland accepts an **explicit name**, which makes the result deterministic.
That matters more than it sounds: the unnamed form allocates `HEADLESS-N` from
a counter that persists across creates and never resets, so any code guessing
the name is a latent bug. This avoids relying on automatically allocated
output names.

### Sway and wlroots compositors — likely straightforward, unimplemented

`ext-image-copy-capture-v1` is implemented by wlroots 0.18+, so **capture should
work unchanged**. Output creation exists too:

```bash
swaymsg create_output
```

The obstacle is naming: Sway names the output itself (`HEADLESS-N`) with no way
to choose, so the daemon must diff `swaymsg -t get_outputs` before and after to
learn what it just made. Mechanical, but it needs writing and testing.

Stub in place; `VirtualOutput::create` returns a clear error rather than
pretending.

### labwc — works, with the output created by you

Contributed by [@perru](https://github.com/perru) (discussion #5) and adapted
here. Capture, encode and transport all work unchanged, as the Sway section
predicts for any wlroots 0.18+ compositor. What differs is the output.

labwc has **no runtime IPC to create one**. wlroots builds headless outputs at
backend initialisation, from `WLR_HEADLESS_OUTPUTS`, and nothing later can add
another — there is no `hyprctl output create` equivalent to call. So this
backend inverts the contract the other two follow: rather than creating an
output and removing it on drop, it **attaches to one that already exists** and
leaves it exactly as it found it.

That makes the output a property of your session, not of moreland, and you
provision it when labwc starts:

```bash
WLR_HEADLESS_OUTPUTS=1 labwc      # or set it in your session/login script
wlr-randr                          # lists it, usually as HEADLESS-1
moreland --output-name HEADLESS-1
```

`--output-name` is **required** here. The default is `moreland`, a name
wlroots will never assign — it numbers headless outputs `HEADLESS-N` and
offers no way to choose. Point it at an output that does not exist and the
daemon says so at startup rather than failing per device event.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **The output persists.** It was not created by the daemon, so it is not
  removed on exit; it stays in your layout between sessions. That is the
  trade for labwc having no create call, not an oversight.
- **The daemon does not resize or move it.** `wlr-randr` could, but you chose
  this output deliberately and reshaping a real part of your session behind
  your back is worse than honouring how you configured it. So `--position`,
  `--position-y` and the resolution flags do not shape the output on labwc —
  the stream carries whatever mode the output already has, and the tablet
  fits that image to its panel. Match them yourself if the aspect ratio is
  wrong:

  ```bash
  wlr-randr --output HEADLESS-1 --custom-mode 1920x1200@60 --pos 0,1080
  ```
- **`wlr-randr` is a runtime dependency** on this compositor, and doubles as
  the round-trip that confirms labwc is really the running session.

Detection accepts `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` of either `labwc` or `wlroots`, since
labwc has reported both across versions.

### KDE Plasma / KWin — works, via the Plasma protocol

Tested on **KWin 6.7.4 / Plasma 6.7.4** in a Wayland session. Both
questions this section used to pose are now answered.

**1. Does KWin implement `ext-image-copy-capture-v1`? No.**

```console
$ wayland-info | grep -E 'image_copy_capture|image_capture_source'
$ grep -rl ext_image_copy_capture_manager_v1 /usr/lib/ /usr/bin/
$
```

Neither global is advertised, and the interface name does not appear in any
installed binary — so this is not a privileged-client restriction that a
different client could work around. The protocol is simply not implemented.
`zwlr_screencopy_manager_v1` is absent too, so there is no legacy fallback.
**`crates/capture` has nothing to bind to on KDE**, and no amount of work in
`output.rs` changes that.

`zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` v5 *is* present, so the zero-copy import path itself is
fine. Capture is the only missing piece.

**2. How does KWin create a virtual output?** Through the same protocol that
solves the first problem — which is the useful finding here:

```console
$ strings -a /usr/lib/qt6/plugins/kwin/plugins/screencast.so | grep -i virtualoutput
_ZN4KWin21ScreencastV1Interface32virtualOutputScreencastRequestedEPNS_...
```

`zkde_screencast_unstable_v1` has a `stream_virtual_output` request that
**creates a virtual output and returns a PipeWire stream of it in one call** —
the mechanism behind KDE's own "virtual monitor" feature. So KDE does not need
the two separate backends this document originally assumed. It needs one
PipeWire capture path, and virtual-output creation comes free with it.

`kpipewire` is already installed on a normal Plasma system and exposes exactly
the right surface (`pipewiresourcestream.h`, `dmabufhandler.h`) for reference.

The protocol is privileged and absent from a plain registry listing, but **not
portal-only** — a client binds it directly after declaring it in a desktop
entry:

```ini
X-KDE-Wayland-Interfaces=zkde_screencast_unstable_v1
```

A per-user desktop entry under `~/.local/share/applications` is sufficient;
no root access is required. KWin matches the client's executable path rather
than how it was launched. `Exec` must be an absolute path — the bare
form is silently denied. `install.sh` writes this entry **only on a Plasma
session**, so a Hyprland install is not littered with it; force it with
`MORELAND_INSTALL_DESKTOP_ENTRY=1`. The mechanics and the traps are in
[06-plasma-backend.md](06-plasma-backend.md).

Note that the portal is *not* the answer here: it appears unable to create
virtual monitors, which is why KRDP ships a Plasma-specific session alongside
its portal one.

### GNOME / Mutter — hardest

Mutter deliberately does **not** implement the wlr or ext capture protocols; it
exposes screen capture only through `org.gnome.Mutter.ScreenCast` and
xdg-desktop-portal. So the current capture backend cannot work at all — this is
not a small patch.

Virtual monitors are reachable through Mutter's remote-desktop DBus interfaces
in recent GNOME versions, but pairing that with portal-based capture is
essentially a second backend.

## The portable route: xdg-desktop-portal + PipeWire

If broad compositor support matters more than the last few milliseconds, the
answer is the portal:

- **Works everywhere** — GNOME, KDE, wlroots, all of it
- Still delivers **DMA-BUF**, so the zero-copy path into VA-API survives
- Costs a permission dialog on first use (avoidable afterwards with a restore
  token) and a small amount of latency for the extra PipeWire hop

That would make the capture stage universal, leaving only virtual-output
creation per-compositor. It is the right move if this project wants to support
more than one desktop, and it is not currently implemented.

## GPU compatibility

Two encoder backends, selected at runtime from what GStreamer has registered
(`crates/encoder/src/lib.rs::select_backend`):

- **VA-API** — `vapostproc` → `vah264enc`. AMD VCN, Intel QuickSync.
- **NVENC via GL** — `glupload` → `glcolorconvert` → `gldownload` → `nvh264enc`.
  NVIDIA. `nvh264enc` is checked first and wins when present, because
  `nvidia-vaapi-driver` is decode-only: `vah264enc` either fails to create or
  produces a stream nothing decodes.

The GL hop on the NVIDIA path exists because `cudaupload` does not accept
`memory:DMABuf` in GStreamer 1.28, and the buffers the compositor hands out are
tiled — their modifier carries the NVIDIA vendor prefix `0x03` in the top byte.
`glupload` is the one importer that reads the modifier and asks the GL driver
to import the tiled buffer correctly; `gldownload` then produces the NV12 that
`nvh264enc` accepts. A straight mmap of a tiled NVIDIA buffer produces a
scrambled image, so this is not an optimisation — it is the only correct path
on that vendor.

**Modifier probing** applies to the VA-API path.
`encoder::supported_modifiers()` asks the local VA stack which DRM format
modifiers it can import, instead of assuming AMD's. This matters because
compositors offer modifiers the encoder cannot read — on AMD, DCC-compressed
tilings — and GBM will happily prefer one. The failure mode is not an error but
a **silent fallback to a CPU copy**, which quietly destroys the zero-copy
design. A hardcoded modifier is correct on exactly one GPU.

Verified on AMD VCN 2.x (VA-API). **NVENC-via-GL is verified on NVIDIA
Turing** (a GTX 1650 Mobile running KWin 6.7.4). Later generations should be
no different — `nvh264enc`, `glupload` and `gldownload` are vendor-agnostic
over GStreamer, and the tiling modifier the GL importer reads is not
generation-specific. Intel QuickSync uses the same VA-API chain as AMD and
should work; untested.

## Android compatibility

The most portable part of the project.

- **API 29+** (`minSdk`), tested on API 34
- Needs a hardware H.264 decoder — universal on anything from the last decade
- Nothing vendor-specific is required. The Qualcomm low-latency hint is set
  opportunistically and ignored elsewhere

The default **1920×1200** is appropriate for a 16:10 display. For a 16:9
tablet, prefer `--width 1920 --height 1080`; a mismatched aspect ratio may
letterbox.

## Distributions

**The distribution is very nearly irrelevant.** It is a tempting axis because
it is the one users know they have, but nothing in the pipeline asks what
distro it is on. What actually decides the answer is three things, and every
mainstream distro can supply all three:

| Requirement | Minimum | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A compositor implementing `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` | Hyprland, or wlroots 0.18+ | Capture has nothing to bind to otherwise |
| GStreamer with the `va` plugin | 1.22+ (developed against 1.28) | `vapostproc` and `vah264enc` |
| A VA-API driver | Mesa `radeonsi`/`iHD`, or `nvidia-vaapi-driver` | Hardware H.264 encode |

A distro influences the outcome only indirectly, in two ways: **which desktop
it installs by default**, and **how old its GStreamer is**. So "does Fedora
work?" is not really a question about Fedora — Fedora Workstation ships GNOME
and is blocked for the same reason Plasma is, while Fedora with Hyprland
installed should work. The same holds for Ubuntu, Debian and openSUSE.

The one genuine distro-level trap is GStreamer age: the `va` plugin element set
only became usable around 1.22, so a conservative stable release (Debian
oldstable, older Ubuntu LTS, RHEL) can fail on that alone even under Hyprland.

Package names, since those *are* distro-specific — only the Arch line is
verified, the rest are best-effort and untested:

```bash
# Arch / EndeavourOS / Manjaro — verified
sudo pacman -S --needed rust gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good \
                        gst-plugin-va libva libva-utils android-tools \
                        android-udev wayland-utils

# Fedora — UNVERIFIED
sudo dnf install rust cargo gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1-plugins-good \
                 gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free libva libva-utils android-tools \
                 wayland-utils

# Debian / Ubuntu — UNVERIFIED, check GStreamer is 1.22+
sudo apt install rustc cargo gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
                 gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
                 libva2 vainfo adb wayland-utils
```

`scripts/moreland-doctor.sh` detects the distro and prints the matching line
for whatever is missing.

## Contributing a compositor backend

1. Confirm the capture protocols exist: `scripts/moreland-doctor.sh`, or by
   hand with `wayland-info | grep -E 'image_copy_capture|image_capture_source'`.
   If they are absent, stop — the work is a PipeWire capture backend, not a
   compositor backend, and `output.rs` is not where it goes.
2. Add a variant to `Compositor` in `crates/daemon/src/output.rs` and detect it
   from the environment
3. Implement create/remove for it
4. Verify capture alone first — `capture-probe <output> --dmabuf --frames 120`
   isolates the compositor from the rest of the pipeline

Please report what you find even if it does not work; a documented failure is
more useful than silence.
