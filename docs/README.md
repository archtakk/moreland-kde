# Moreland

Turn a USB-connected Android tablet into a second monitor for Hyprland.

Wayland-native, hardware-encoded, zero-copy. Built for one specific machine and
one specific tablet rather than for generality — every design decision below is
backed by a measurement taken on that hardware.

## Stage status

| Stage | Status |
|---|---|
| 0 — Prerequisites | done |
| 1 — Capture | done, measured |
| 2 — VAAPI encode | done, measured |
| 3 — Transport | host side done, verified byte-exact |
| 4 — Android app | done, verified end to end |
| 5 — Daemon + automation | done, verified |
| 6 — KDE Plasma backend | done: virtual output, PipeWire capture, and end-to-end streaming |
| 7 — Benchmark + tune | next: the 24 ms display-queue term |

## Latency budget

Measured figures replace estimates as each stage lands.

| Stage | Budget |
|---|---|
| Capture → DMA-BUF | **2.1 ms** (measured) |
| VAAPI encode | **6.3 ms** (measured) |
| Transport + decode + display queue | **24.2 ms** (measured) |
| Panel scanout | 7–16 ms (not measurable in software) |
| **Glass to glass** | **~33–48 ms** |

Measured stream: 1920×1200@60, H.264 High/L5.0, no B-frames, **16.2 Mbps** —
5.9% of the measured 275 Mbps USB ceiling.

Target is 35–45 ms typical. Sub-20 ms is not achievable with compressed video
over USB to an Android device — see [00-system-survey.md](00-system-survey.md)
for why.

## Install

```bash
./install.sh
systemctl --user enable --now moreland.service
```

Then plug the tablet in. Nothing needs root; nothing is written outside `$HOME`.

The tablet app must be built and installed once:

```bash
cd android && ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk ./gradlew assembleRelease
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```
