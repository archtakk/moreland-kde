//! KDE Plasma capture backend — virtual output half.
//!
//! KWin implements no `ext-` or `wlr-` capture protocol and KDE has declined
//! to add one, so [`crate::session`] cannot work there at all. What KWin does
//! offer is `zkde_screencast_unstable_v1`, whose `stream_virtual_output`
//! request **creates a virtual output and returns a PipeWire node for it in a
//! single call** — the two problems the project treated separately on Hyprland
//! collapse into one here.
//!
//! This module is that call. Consuming the PipeWire node is the other half
//! and lives in the sibling `pipewire` module; see
//! `docs/06-plasma-backend.md`.
//!
//! **The protocol is privileged.** KWin only advertises the global to a client
//! whose desktop entry declares:
//!
//! ```ini
//! X-KDE-Wayland-Interfaces=zkde_screencast_unstable_v1
//! ```
//!
//! with an **absolute** `Exec` path. Get either wrong and the global is simply
//! absent — there is no error, no log line, nothing to grep for. That is why
//! [`PlasmaVirtualOutput::create`] spends its error message on the grant
//! rather than saying "global not found".
//!
//! The output's lifetime is the Wayland connection's. Dropping this struct, or
//! losing the connection, removes the monitor.
